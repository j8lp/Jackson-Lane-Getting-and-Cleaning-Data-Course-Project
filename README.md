This script looks in the working directory for a folder called "data," and then checks in that folder for the UCI data sets.  The script extracts the Subject, Activity, and all mean and standard deviation columns from the test and train data sets, combines the two data sets into one, and then groubs by Subject and Activity while taking the averages of the values in the other columns
